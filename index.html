      <h2>Tell me about yourself</h2>
      <p>
        "My name is Daniel Smith. I am a full stack developer. Coming to my skills I know CSS, HTML, JS. Also, I have mastered
        React and Node.js. I have been coding for 10 months and during this time I have done 3 successful team projects and 2
        individual ones. Due to this I am good at core technical skills, organizational ethics and discipline. My goal is to get a
        job in a reputed company like yours where I can use my skills and knowledge to deliver good results in the long term. I am
        eager to achieve a good position in the company to scale up the organization’s production and growth rate and at the same
        time for my personal career growth as well. That’s all about me. And yes, thanks for the opportunity given to introduce
        myself!"
