        "My name is Daniel Smith. I am a full stack developer. Coming to my skills I know CSS, HTML, JS. Also, I have mastered
        React and Node.js. I have been coding for 10 months and during this time I have done 3 successful team projects and 2
        individual ones. Due to this I am good at core technical skills, organizational ethics and discipline. My goal is to get a
        job in a reputed company like yours where I can use my skills and knowledge to deliver good results in the long term. I am
        eager to achieve a good position in the company to scale up the organization`s production and growth rate and at the same
        time for my personal career growth as well. That`s all about me. And yes, thanks for the opportunity given to introduce
        myself!"
