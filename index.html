            "I want to be a front-end developer because I've worked hard to develop skills that are relevant to this industry and
            because this type of work brings me personal satisfaction. I feel especially good when I see that the website I
            created works perfectly. That`s the best reward for me! I've gained a lot of practical experience and become
            intimately familiar with several coding languages. Also, I participated in coding challenges and worked on personal
            coding projects. I'm excited to begin a career as a front-end developer and learn more about this line of work from
            industry professionals."
